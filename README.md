# Project 4 Group 7: Diabetes Prediction

# Steps

### Obtain, clean, and transform the dataset:

1. Obtain the dataset [Diabetes Prediction by Mohammed Mustafa](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle and download it to the local machine

2. Create a database and table schema in PostgreSQL. Then, verify the data was imported correctly.

3. Retrieve the dataset using SQLAlchemy in Python

4. Clean and transform the dataset

   - convert gender and smoking_history to numeric boolean values.
   - convert BMI, HbA1c, and blood glucose levels according to ranges.
